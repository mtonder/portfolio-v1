          I have always been close to IT, so I had no doubts about my career path. I graduated from
          the University of Zielona GÃ³ra in 2014 and since then I have been actively working as a
          developer. At the beginning of my career I worked as a fullstack, but in 2016 I decided to
          specialize in frontend.
          <br />
          <br /> I'm team player with an eye for detail. I have strong creative and analytical
          skills. Perfectionist and minimalism fan. These qualities drive me to deliver quality
          solutions and make a meaningful contribution to every project I undertake. If you have any
          questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me - I'm always open to
          collaboration and new opportunities.
