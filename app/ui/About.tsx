          I have always been close to IT, so I had no doubts about my career path. I graduated from
          the University of Zielona GÃ³ra in 2014 and since then I have been actively working as a
          developer. At the beginning of my career I worked as a fullstack, but in 2016 I decided to
          specialise in frontend. About me professionally: perfectionist, conscientious, creative.
          These qualities drive me to deliver quality solutions and make a meaningful contribution
          to every project I undertake. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don&apos;t
          hesitate to contact me - I&apos;m always open to collaboration and new opportunities.
